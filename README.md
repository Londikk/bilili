#WARNING
I KNOW there are bugs, for example - game crashes if u try to take a look on the custom atlas. I know about almost all of them, i just dont know how to fix them. I was very wrong, when i started this "project" with 0 experience.

And if u still want to play this shitty pile of code, pls report if something goes wrong, i work on this mod 5 hours a day and the last thing i think of is play-testing.
